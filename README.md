# CrystalNodes
*By Skylake*

To apply the editor background material, go to the plugin content folder and find SB_GraphBackground brush, copy that brush to your editor settings. Better disable editor grids.

Have fun!

## Limitations:
In material editors with non-UI domain materials, the dynamic parameters of node material (MousePos, ViewPos, etc) won't update properly. I have no idea why it's happening.
